# sparkmeetup
This repository contains the files for the 1st Introduction to Spark MeetUp.

In this Meetup we explain some features about Spark and do some basic examples. In this repository we have uploaded all of the complete examples about the Meetup.

To execute the Spark script (SparkKMeansExample.py) you need to run spark-submit and pass the JSON file as a parameter. To facilite these example, we upload two diferents files with tweets, so you can use this files to test Spark.

If you want to get the tweets by yourself, we provide the TweetsExample.py script. With this script, you only need to configure the config.py file and provide yout Twitter API credentials. Once you have all of this, you need to execute the following command to install Twepy library: ```python setup.py install ``` and you can obtain the tweets.

We are open to any improvement in any of the documents. You can create a pull-request and we discuss there about it.
